# Auto-Learn Introduction
Auto-Learn is a machine learning Android application for our Fundamentals of Software Engineering class that we took in Spring 2020.

 There are six possible classifications for Auto-Learn to classify your image:
             
             * Convertible
      
             * SUV
             
             * Truck
             
             * Van
             
             * Saloon/Sedan
             
             * Coupe

GitHub was used to host our git repository, it contains the following items:

* **AutoLearnApp** - Android studio project
* **Documentation** - Project Documentation
* **Machine Learning** - Dataset and ML material
* **README.md** - Project description and instructions

Please follow the instructions below to get started testing our application.
When testing our application ensure that the **minimum Android version** is set to **7.0.0 Nougat**
(API level 24). We recommend using a **Nexus 5X** emulator for testing.

Physical devices that have been used to test our application include:
* **Galaxy Tab A 8.0**
* **Galaxy S8 Active**
* **Galaxy S7 Edge**

# Machine Learning
### Data Set
Our dataset consists of 5000+ images in a Google Shared Drive folder named [car_images](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1C1nC6vt0jxQ1o0sz7Ioq7MhCGv-PvNNT) which contains six folders representing our **six classifications**.
This is the dataset that was used to train the machine learning model generated by **FirebaseAutoML Vision Edge API**
* [AutoML Vision documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/docs)

### Accessing our Machine Learning Code
Contains a Google Collab with the code for our custom machine learning model. This model is currently being developed.
Our current work can be found on our [Google Shared Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_GNGbpxACoNOLmNrdFIqik332ICB5RcJ)

* To get started click on the **autolearn_model.ipynb** in the Shared Drive.

### TF_Model
* **autolearn_model.ipynb** - local copy of the colab (**must use Google Colab**) 
* **labels.txt** - Text file contains the six classifications of vehicles
* **model.tflite** - The current custom model using the code in the Colab
* **model_IO.py** - python script to determine the input for the model in **Android**
